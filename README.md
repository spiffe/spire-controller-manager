# SPIRE Controller Manager

[![Build Status](https://github.com/spiffe/spire-controller-manager/actions/workflows/nightly_build.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/spiffe/spire-controller-manager/actions/workflows/nightly_build.yaml)
[![Pre-Production Phase](https://github.com/spiffe/spiffe/blob/main/.img/maturity/pre-prod.svg)](https://github.com/spiffe/spiffe/blob/main/MATURITY.md#pre-production)


A [Kubernetes Controller](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/)
manager which facilitates the registration of workloads and establishment
of federation relationships.

## How it Works

### Custom Resources

#### ClusterSPIFFEID

The [ClusterSPIFFEID](docs/clusterspiffeid-crd.md) resource is a cluster scoped
CRD that describes the shape of the identity that is applied to workloads, as
well as selectors that describe which workloads the identity applies to.

#### ClusterFederatedTrustDomain

The [ClusterFederatedTrustDomain](docs/clusterfederatedtrustdomain-crd.md)
resource is a cluster scoped CRD that describes a federation relationship for
the cluster.

### Reconciliation

#### Workload Registration

To facilitate workload registration, the SPIRE Controller manager registers
controllers against the following resources:

- [Pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/)
- [ClusterSPIFFEID](docs/clusterspiffeid-crd.md)

When changes are detected on these resources, a workload reconciliation process
is triggered. This process determines which SPIRE entries should exist based on
the existing Pods and ClusterSPIFFEID resources which apply to those pods. It
creates, updates, and deletes entries on SPIRE server as appropriate to match
the declared state.

#### Federation

To facilitate federation, the SPIRE Controller manager registers controllers
against the following resources:

- [ClusterFederatedTrustDomain](docs/clusterfederatedtrustdomain-crd.md)

When changes are detected on these resources, a federation relationship
reconciliation process is triggered. This process determines which SPIRE
federation relationships should exist based on the existing
ClusterFederatedTrustDomain resources. It creates, updates, and deletes
federation relationships as appropriate to match the declared state.

## Deployment

The SPIRE Controller Manager is designed to be deployed in the same pod as the
SPIRE Server. It communicates with the SPIRE Server API using a private Unix
Domain Socket within a shared volume. It requires [configuration](docs/spire-controller-manager-config.md)
for the environment where it is being deployed.

The [demo](demo) includes [sample configuration](demo/config/cluster1) for
deploying the SPIRE Controller Manager, SPIRE, and the SPIFFE CSI driver,
including requisite RBAC and Webhook configuration.

## Troubleshooting

### Workloads

#### Workload Not Registered

##### ClusterSPIFFEID Not Defined

Define a ClusterSPIFFEID that applies to the workload pod.

##### Workload Pod Excluded by ClusterSPIFFEID PodSelector or NamespaceSelector

Adjust the ClusterSPIFFEID selectors.

##### Failed to Render Templates Against Workload Pod or Node

Check the ClusterSPIFFEID status for entry render failures. Check logs to
determine why the rendering failed.

##### Failed to Register with SPIRE Server

Check logs for API failures talking to SPIRE Server.

### Federation

#### Federation Relationship Missing

##### ClusterFederatedTrustDomain Not Defined

Define a ClusterFederatedTrustDomain for the target trust domain.

##### ClusterFederatedTrustDomain TrustDomain Conflict

Ensure each ClusterFederatedTrustDomain resource has a unique trust domain. The
controller will only ignore all but the oldest ClusterFederatedTrustDomain
resource with a conflicting trust domain. 

#### Workload Not Federated With Trust Domain

Check the ClusterSPIFFEID for the workload. The federatesWith field must
include the federated trust domain.

## Security

### Reporting a Vulnerability

Vulnerabilities can be reported by sending an email to security@spiffe.io. A
confirmation email will be sent to acknowledge the report within 72 hours. A
second acknowledgement will be sent within 7 days when the vulnerability has
been positively or negatively confirmed.
